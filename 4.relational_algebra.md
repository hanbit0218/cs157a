# Relational Algebra Summary

## 1. Fundamentals

### What is an Algebra?
- A mathematical system with:
  - Operands: Variables or values
  - Operators: Symbols for procedures constructing new values

### Relational Algebra
- Operands: Relations or variables representing relations
- Operators: Designed for common database operations
- Purpose: Query language for relations

## 2. Core Relational Algebra Operations

1. Set operations (Union, Intersection, Difference)
   - Requires same relation schema for both operands
2. Selection (σ): Picking certain rows
3. Projection (π): Picking certain columns
4. Products and joins: Compositions of relations
5. Renaming of relations and attributes

## 3. Detailed Operations

### Selection (σ)
- Syntax: R1 := σC(R2)
- C is a condition on R2's attributes
- R1 contains tuples of R2 satisfying C

### Projection (π)
- Syntax: R1 := πL(R2)
- L is a list of R2's attributes
- R1 contains selected attributes, eliminating duplicates

### Extended Projection
- Allows expressions in attribute list
- Examples: A+B→C, duplicate attributes

### Product (Cartesian Product)
- Syntax: R3 := R1 Χ R2
- Pairs each tuple of R1 with each of R2

### Theta-Join
- Syntax: R3 := R1 ⋈C R2
- Equivalent to σC(R1 Χ R2)

### Natural Join
- Syntax: R3 := R1 ⋈ R2
- Equates same-name attributes, removes duplicates

### Renaming (ρ)
- Syntax: R1 := ρR1(A1,…,An)(R2)
- Simplified: R1(A1,…,An) := R2

## 4. Building Complex Expressions

### Notations
1. Sequences of assignment statements
2. Expressions with several operators
3. Expression trees

### Operator Precedence
1. [σ, π, ρ] (highest)
2. [Χ, ⋈]
3. ∩
4. [∪, —]

## 5. SQL as Algebraic Query Language

### Key Relationships
- R ∩ S = R – (R – S)
- R ⋈C S = σc(RxS)
- R ⋈ S = πL(σc(RxS))

## 6. Constraints on Relations

### Types of Constraints
- R = 0 (empty result)
- R ⊆ S (subset constraint)
- Referential Integrity: πA(R) ⊆ πB(S)
- Key Constraints: σR.key=S.key AND R.attr≠S.attr(R x S) = 0

## 7. Algebra of Bags

- Bags (multisets) allow duplicate elements
- SQL uses bag semantics
- Operations: Selection, Projection, Product, Theta-Join, Union, Intersection, Difference

# Practice Problems

1. Find employee names working in New York departments.
   - Given: Employee(ID, Name, DeptID), Department(DeptID, DeptName, Location)

2. Find students taking courses in their major.
   - Given: Student(StudentID, Name, Major), Course(CourseID, Title, Instructor, Major)

3. Find OrderIDs with more than 5 different products.
   - Given: Orders(OrderID, CustomerID, Date), OrderDetails(OrderID, ProductID, Quantity)

4. Find actors working with the same director in multiple movies.
   - Given: Movie(Title, Year, Director), Actor(Name, MovieTitle, MovieYear)

5. Find passengers who've flown with all airlines.
   - Given: Flight(FlightNum, FromCity, ToCity, Airline), Passenger(PassengerID, Name, FlightNum)

---

# Answer Sheet

1. πName(Employee ⋈ σLocation="New York"(Department))

2. πStudent.Name(Student ⋈Student.Major=Course.Major Course)

3. πOrderID(γOrderID, COUNT(DISTINCT ProductID)→ProductCount(OrderDetails) ⋈ σProductCount>5)

4. πName(γName, Director, COUNT(DISTINCT Title)→MovieCount(Actor ⋈ Movie) ⋈ σMovieCount>1)

5. πName(Passenger ⋈ Flight) ÷ πAirline(Flight)

Note: Solutions use extended relational algebra operations like grouping (γ) and division (÷).
